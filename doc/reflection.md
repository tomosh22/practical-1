**Python**

I have used python in the past during both my GCSEs and A Levels, it is a very versatile and easy to use programming language and I will continue to use it in the future

**Pycharm IDE**

Pycharm was the IDE I used for all of my A-Level python work so I am quite familar with it. I am comfortable with the idea of projects
but I have never used git alongside Pycharm. However this does seem to be very simple as the tools to commit and push are easily accessible from
within the PyCharm IDE

**Git**

I used Git, GitHub to be specific, to maintain my A level coursework so I am familiar with committing and pushing changes to a repository.
I have never used GitLab but it seems to work in a very similar way so I will continue to use it for my version control.

**Pipenv**

I have a small amount of experience with pip to install 3rd party libraries but I have never heard of pipenv before. 3rd party libraries are a crucial part of programming so I
am sure I will gain sufficient experience using this. Pipenv was not functioning correctly so I had to install the panda3d package manually using the PyCharm
interpreter settings.

**The keyboard Library**

In the past I have just used the python console's input() function to gain input from the user, but this was not appropriate in this situation
so I was forced to use another method of obtaining input. The keyboard library's .is_pressed() function makes it very easy to detect whether
or not a specific key is up or down in real time.
