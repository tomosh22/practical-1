**Pycharm IDE**

Pycharm was the IDE I used for all of my A-Level python work so I am quite familar with it. I am comfortable with the idea of projects
but I have never used git alongside Pycharm. However this does seem to be very simple as the tools to commit and push are easily accessible from
within the PyCharm IDE

**Git**

I used Git, GitHub to be specific, to maintain my A level coursework so I am familiar with committing and pushing changes to a repository.
I have never used GitLab but it seems to work in a very similar way

**Pipenv**

I have a small amount of experience with pip but I have never heard of pipenv before. 3rd party packages are a crucial part of programming so I
am sure I will gain sufficient experience using this. Pipenv was not functioning correctly so I had to install the panda3d package manually using the PyCharm
interpreter settings.
